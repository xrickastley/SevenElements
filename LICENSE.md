1.2 **"Modification"** means any change, edit, or addition made to existing files of the Software.

1.3 **"Independent Module"** means a new file or system created by a Contributor that:
* does not directly replace or modify existing files in the Software, and
* is functionally distinct such that it can be identified as an original creation of the Contributor.

1.4 **"Pull Request (PR)"** means a submission of proposed changes through the official repository's contribution system (e.g., GitHub).

1.5 **"Contributor"** means any individual or entity that submits a Pull Request to the official repository.

### 2. Private Use

You may download and use this software for personal, non-commercial purposes only. Redistribution, public sharing, modification, reverse engineering, or commercial use is prohibited unless expressly permitted by xrickastley in writing, except as provided in Section 3, Section 9 and Section 10 below.

For clarity, viewing and studying the source code as published in the official repository does not constitute reverse engineering.

You may make modifications to the Software for **purely private, non-distributed use**. Such private modifications must not be shared, redistributed, or otherwise made available to third parties. If you wish to share modifications, they must be submitted as a Pull Request in accordance with Section 3.

<hr>

### 3. Limited Modification for Pull Requests

You are granted limited permission to make modifications to the Software **solely for the purpose of submitting changes via a pull request to the official repository at** https://github.com/xrickastley/seven-elements.

1. Any modifications to the existing codebase, once submitted, shall become the property of xrickastley .
2. If your contribution is accepted, you grant xrickastley full rights to integrate, use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, distribute, display in whole or in part, in any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed, modify, and maintain those changes as part of the project.
3. By submitting a Pull Request, you grant xrickastley a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license** to **review, test, and evaluate** the contribution, regardless of whether the Pull Request is merged.
4. If the contribution is merged, the additional rights described in Sections 3–5 shall apply.
Independent Modules remain the property of the Contributor, but the Contributor may not impose licensing terms on such Modules that conflict with the rights granted to the Maintainer under this License.

<hr>

### 4. Independent Modules by Contributors

An **Independent Module** means a set of files, classes, or substantial code segments that:

1. Are not based on, derived from, or substantially similar to any portion of the existing codebase; and
2. Can function independently of the existing code, except for integration hooks necessary to operate within the project.

If your pull request introduces an Independent Module:

1. You retain copyright to that module.
2. You grant xrickastley a **perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license** to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, distribute and display such modules, in whole or in part, in any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed **solely as part of this project**.
3. If the Pull Request is merged, you must ensure that any external license you apply to that module is updated to explicitly allow the rights granted in this License, and cannot conflict with them.
4. You waive any right to bring legal action against xrickastley or the project's maintainers for such use.
5. You acknowledge that the module may remain in the codebase indefinitely, even if you later request its removal.

<hr>

### 5. Mixed Contributions

If your pull request contains both:

* Modifications to existing code; and
* An Independent Module;
then:
* All modified portions of the existing code become the property of xrickastley.
* The Independent Module remains yours but is subject to the license grant in Section 4.

<hr>

### 6. Reclassification of Misrepresented Modules

If an Independent Module is found to be substantially based on or adapted from the existing codebase, it shall be reclassified as a modification under Section 3, and ownership shall transfer to xrickastley accordingly.

**6.1 Final Determination of Classification**

After a pull request is merged, xrickastley shall have the sole authority to determine whether any part of the contribution qualifies as an Independent Module or constitutes a modification to existing code. This determination shall be final and binding, and the contributor agrees to accept this classification as a condition of merging.
If no explicit classification is posted in accordance with Section 6.2, the fallback rules described therein shall apply automatically.

**6.2 Documentation in Pull Request Discussion**

The classification will be documented in the pull request discussion on the project's official repository before the pull request is closed, using the following format:

```
**Contribution Classification:**
- Independent Modules: [list files/features]
- Modifications to Existing Code: [list files/features]

As per project license, Independent Modules remain under contributor copyright
but are licensed to the project for perpetual use. Modifications become part
of the main codebase.
```

The classification must be posted by xrickastley **within one (1) week after merging and prior to closing the pull request**, and shall serve as the official record of ownership and licensing status for the contribution. Failure to post such classification within the timeframe will result in **all modifications to existing files automatically deemed to be non-Independent Modules (and therefore property of xrickastley), while any newly added files shall automatically be deemed Independent Modules subject to Section 4.**

<hr>

### 7. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

By submitting any pull request to the repository, you agree that:

1. You have the legal right to contribute the code.
2. Your contribution does not infringe on any third-party rights.
3. You grant xrickastley a **perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license** to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, distribute and display such modules, in whole or in part, in any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed **solely as part of this project**.
4. If the contribution is merged, you grant the additional rights described in Sections 2–5, and you must update any license you apply to Independent Modules so that it expressly permits the rights granted under this License.
5. All modifications to existing files become the property of the Maintainer.
4. You will comply with the attribution requirement for modifications to existing code.
5. You understand that no compensation will be provided for contributions.
6. **Any license you may later apply to the same contribution outside this project shall not affect the rights granted under this agreement.**
7. **You acknowledge and accept the fallback classification rule in Section 6.2, whereby failure by xrickastley to post a classification within the specified timeframe results in automatic classification as defined by Section 6.2.**
