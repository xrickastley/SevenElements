	<b>Seven Elements</b> is a Minecraft mod that brings Genshin Impact's Elemental Combat System to Minecraft with the goal of staying faithful to the systems that hold it such as the <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Gauge_Theory">Elemental Gauge Theory</a> and <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Internal_Cooldown">Internal Cooldown</a> while ensuring a smooth integration within Minecraft.

<h2 align="center">Welcome to the Seven Elements Repository!</h2>

This is the GitHub monorepo for the Seven Elements mod.

Download the mod from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/seven-elements) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/seven-elements)!

Wanna get started? You can visit the [wiki](https://xrickastley.github.io/SevenElements/wiki/)! You might just find what you need there. Alternatively, you may also visit the mod's [javadoc](https://xrickastley.github.io/SevenElements/javadoc/)!

Wanna report a bug? You can use GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/xrickastley/SevenElements/issues)! Make sure to search for existing issues first, I don't really wanna run into duplicate issues. It would also be really helpful if you can provide:
- The mods that you were using,
- Your Minecraft version,
- The version of Seven Elements you were using,
- What should happen, and what happened instead. (Screenshots are really useful here!)
- A client and/or server log. Don't forget to add a label! It helps me classify your issue more easily.

Seven Elements also accept implementation issues! Like standard bugs, you can use GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/xrickastley/SevenElements/issues) to report these issues, and make sure to search for existing issues first. However, these issues also have a different specific format than standard bugs. For these, please provide:
- Your Minecraft version,
- The version of Seven Elements you were using,
- A YouTube video or link to a *credible* page that shows or explains the behavior of the *feature* in Genshin.
- What was expected to happen in Seven Elements, and what happened instead. (Screenshots are really useful here!)

Wanna improve the mod or create a Pull Request? Go ahead, though *please* ensure that you **agree** to the terms provided in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/xrickastley/SevenElements/blob/1.21-1.21.1/LICENSE.md).

If you wanna contribute to the wiki, the branch for it is [wiki](https://github.com/xrickastley/SevenElements/tree/wiki)!
