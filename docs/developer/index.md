	<b>Seven Elements</b> is a Minecraft mod that brings Genshin Impact's Elemental Combat System to Minecraft with the goal of staying faithful to the systems that hold it such as the <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Gauge_Theory">Elemental Gauge Theory</a> and <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Internal_Cooldown">Internal Cooldown</a> while ensuring a smooth integration within Minecraft.

## Getting Started

This part of the wiki is for data pack or mod developers looking to extend or integrate with Seven Elements.

If you just want to know how to **play** with the Seven Elements mod, click [here](../guide/index.md) instead.

To start, you may look at the sidebar for the documentation page you may need. Most, if not all the information you need should be in its corresponding documentation page.

When developing a mod, if the documentation page you need does not exist, try looking at the mod's [javadoc](https://xrickastley.github.io/SevenElements/javadoc/)! Alternatively, you may **view** the source code over at the [Seven Elements GitHub repository](https://github.com/xrickastley/SevenElements)
