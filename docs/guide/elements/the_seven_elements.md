# The Seven Elements

In Genshin Impact *and* **Seven Elements**, there exists the seven Elements: <span class="pyro">**Pyro**</span>, <span class="hydro">**Hydro**</span>, <span class="anemo">**Anemo**</span>, <span class="electro">**Electro**</span>, <span class="dendro">**Dendro**</span>, <span class="cryo">**Cryo**</span>, and <span class="geo">**Geo**</span>. Non-elemental damage is considered **Physical**.

By combining specific elements together, you're able to trigger [Elemental Reactions](./elemental_reactions.md)!

When applying an element to an entity, it will decay over time, so there isn't any "infinite elemental application"!

## Elemental Combat

&nbsp; &nbsp; *Main page: [Elemental Combat](../elements/elemental_combat.md)*

In Seven Elements, you may infuse your attacks with one of the seven Elements and deal Elemental Damage of that element.

## Elemental Reactions

&nbsp; &nbsp; *Main page: [Elemental Reactions](../elements/elemental_reactions.md)*

When applying an element on a target already afflicted with an element, various Elemental Reactions may be triggered.

## Elemental Application Systems

&nbsp; &nbsp; *See also: [Elemental Gauge Theory](./elemental_gauge_theory.md) and [Internal Cooldown](./internal_cooldown.md)*

Elements aren't a binary state of *applied* or *removed*, and are rather represented as a certain amount of *[gauge units](./elemental_gauge_theory.md#elemental-auras-and-the-aura-tax)*. Elements can also only be applied in certain intervals, where elemental damage dealt within the interval *only* deals elemental damage but does not apply an Element.
