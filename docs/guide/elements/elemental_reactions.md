# Elemental Reactions

An **Elemental Reaction** is the result of combining two valid elements together! Each reaction has its own effect, which can be used to your advantage!

## Transformative Reactions

**Transformative Reactions** are reactions that have their own instance of damage. This means that the target receives two *hits*: one from the attack, and one from the reaction.

The damage dealt by these reactions scale off the `levelMultiplier` game rule and their specific *Reaction Multiplier*. They also bypass Shields and the DMG cooldown, have no impact, deal no knockback and do not trigger the DMG cooldown timer.

## Amplifying Reactions

**Amplifying Reactions** are reactions that **amplify** the damage that triggered the reaction.

These reactions apply a **multiplier** on the damage that triggered the reaction, amplifying the damage further.

## Additive Reactions

**Additive Reactions** are reactions that **add** onto the damage that triggered the reaction.

These reactions apply an **additive bonus** that scales on the `levelMultiplier` game rule, applied as **early** as possible. For players, this is applied **after** the weapon damage and the **1.5x** CRIT hit multiplier.

## Other Reactions

These are the other reactions not classified as any of the above, and are usually ones that apply effects or other Elemental Auras that allow you to trigger a new set of reactions not triggerable with the standard seven Elements.
